    "UseJunction is open-source AI coding observability for teams.

        "AI coding observability is the practice of measuring how an engineering organization uses AI coding tools across people, teams, devices, models, and vendors. It answers operational questions that a single vendor dashboard cannot: which tools are actually used, what usage costs, where plan limits are approaching, and whether the telemetry itself is healthy.",
        "UseJunction creates that shared operating view without turning AI adoption into employee surveillance. The focus is tool usage, spend, reliability, plan utilization, and device coverage—not keystrokes, screenshots, or hours in an editor.",
